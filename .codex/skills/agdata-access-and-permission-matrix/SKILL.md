# access and permission matrix

Read [the canonical module dependency map](../../../docs/architecture/agdata-module-dependency-map.md) and symbol index before editing.

## Owned Files, Canonical Functions & SQL Contracts

- Runtime: assets/app-runtime.js and declaration-only assets/row-workflow-functions.js; access editor: assets/user-access-control.js. Canonical functions: resolveUserAccessMatrix, renderAccessMatrix, canRequestSalesRep.
- Server: supabase/functions/_shared/user-access-matrix.ts, app-api user_access, public.user_access, public.save_user_access_matrix_v23119 and suspend_tag_private.publish_inventory_evidence_v23119. Reuse public.save_drive_evidence_v3; never grant direct evidence-table writes.

## Cross-Layer Blast Radius

Code.gs delivery, private access credentials and outbox contracts stay intact. SQL rechecks the active profile and exact row assignment; app-api verifies native sessions and command identity. Browser matrix data is display state, never mutation authority. Preserve same-account SWR/LKG rows, drafts, and durable Request submission. The new bounded authenticated GET /rest/v1/user_access uses only the sanitized relation and its exact fixture.

Shared switchView, goBackUniversal, updateGlobalBackButton, viewHistoryStack and header/search ownership remain canonical; never recreate global Back/navigation.

## Scoped Node verification

```sh
node --test tests/golden-invariants.test.mjs tests/role-access-parity.test.mjs
```

## Forbidden Anti-Patterns (Never Repeat)

- v2.3.119: Never await the active directory to render Request reps, ignore an explicit N, drop the Nally/Nelly alias, or treat a SOC lot mismatch as authority to choose a different nursery location. Publish an acknowledged exact master receipt through the canonical evidence engine and preserve the full AV Note.
