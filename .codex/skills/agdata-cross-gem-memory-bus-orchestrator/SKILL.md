# agdata-cross-gem-memory-bus-orchestrator

Synchronize reviewed incidents, exact ownership and Live/Test contracts without ingesting secrets.

<!-- GEM-BUS:START -->
## Shared Engineering Contract

Scope: Synchronize reviewed incidents, exact ownership and Live/Test contracts without ingesting secrets.

### Exact ownership
- assets/app-runtime.js: module contract.
- assets/runtime-watchdog.js: module contract.
- supabase/functions/app-api/index.ts: module contract.
- Code.gs: module contract.
- scripts/run-tooling-release-checks.mjs: toolingSkillManifests.
- scripts/sync-gem-learning-bus.mjs: synchronizeGemBus, validateIncident.
- scripts/enforce-all-gems-gate.mjs: module contract.
- DOM: No DOM mutation owned; inspect the consuming domain.
- PostgreSQL: No independent SQL writes owned.
Inspect installed constraints/indexes/triggers through pg_catalog before changing SQL; source contracts are not installed-state receipts.

### Preconditions
Read .gnc-local/gem-shared-memory-bus.json and the owning symbol-index entries. Resolve actor, environment, exact row and existing receipt before mutation. Test twins use sandbox apztnscvagayslumnalr and the explicit test namespace map.

### Postconditions and invariant equations
- required gems = 118; all graph edges and reciprocal twins resolve; incident IDs are append-only.
- committed success ⇒ matching actor + command identity + exact durable receipt; failure ⇒ draft and last-known-good display retained.
- production mutations from test = 0; test email recipient set ⊆ {dylan_collyge@greenleafnursery.com}.

### Cross-Gem Dependencies
Read contracts from: test-agdata-cross-gem-memory-bus-orchestrator, agdata-skill-learner, agdata-db-cmu-chief-schema-and-constraint-architect, agdata-app-shell-and-navigation. Publish reviewed changes through scripts/sync-gem-learning-bus.mjs; subscribers are the reverse dependency edges in .gnc-local/gem-shared-memory-bus.json. Twin: test-agdata-cross-gem-memory-bus-orchestrator.

### Runnable verification
- `node scripts/sync-gem-learning-bus.mjs --check`
- `node scripts/enforce-all-gems-gate.mjs`
- SQL inspection: `SELECT schemaname,tablename FROM pg_publication_tables WHERE pubname='supabase_realtime';`
Timing goals require measured receipts; local syntax/AST checks do not prove installed SQL, delivery or physical-device timing.

### Forbidden Anti-Patterns (Never Repeat)
- Do not create a competing canonical helper or infer missing SQL columns from prose.
- Do not replace server authorization, exact receipts, private outbox grants or READY/LKG reads with client assumptions.
Do not infer missing historical incidents or treat a documentation sync as executing a model, sending mail, or authorizing a release.
